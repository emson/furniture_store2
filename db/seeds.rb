  Their daughter Henrietta took on the running of the company at the beginning of 2014. Henrietta has worked for the company for a number of years and is now looking to breath new and exciting life into the company. Having worked for a number of years in a design team at Colefax & Fowler and other design houses she is very much looking forward to the challenge and is at the end of the phone waiting for your questions. Plus with over 20 yearsʼ experience in the furniture business, Henrietta hope to continue to make choosing their unique bespoke furniture, a stress-free and enjoyable experience.

  Henrietta takes enormous pleasure in inviting people to her home set in the pictureque village of Wilton on the Berkshire/Wiltshire borders. It is an ideal relaxed setting in which to view their bespoke sofas, chairs and footstools."
